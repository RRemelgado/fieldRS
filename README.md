fieldRS
<p align="justify" style="line-height:200%;">
R package to support Remote Sensing oriented field work. `fieldRS` was developed at the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, as part of the project Research Network Water in Central Asia (<a href="http://www.cawa-project.net/">CAWa</a>) funded by the German Federal Foreign Office. It is part of the German Water Initiative for Central Asia (the so-called <a href="http://waterca.org/en/the-berlin-process/">Berlin process</a>), which the German Federal Foreign Office launched on 1 April 2008 in order to support peaceful, sustainable and mutually beneficial management of transboundary water resources in Central Asia. The package was designed to ease the collection and management of ground truth data. It provides tools that help select sampling sites, correct and pre-process training data and preview classification results in order to identify potentially incorrect samples.
